HR ATTRITION DASHBOARD


Project Overview
During my internship at MeriSKILL as a Data Analyst, I developed an elaborate HR Attrition Dashboard using Power BI. This dashboard features five interconnected pages, with a central Home Page serving as a gateway to four detailed sections: Demographic, Employee Wellness, Turnover Analysis I, and Turnover Analysis II.
